Make long and complex Navigation Menus wieldable

== Description ==
This plugin makes long and complex navigation menus better manageable by creating groups that can be expanded and collapsed.

By default, all navigation menus in wp-admin will be collapsed. When holding the Option/Alt-key while clicking, all sublevels will be expanded with one click.
